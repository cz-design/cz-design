- 👋 Hi, I’m Chris! @cz-design
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, audio engineering, electrical & mechanical engineering, and more. I currently work as an industrial maintenance supervisor and am always learning new skills with my free time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front end development from a Meta certificate program - but I have been doing web dev for about 5 years learning from free online sources like W3Schools.com (I LOVE IT!)
- \m/ I am also creating a modern rock album about the exhilarating and traumatic experience of discovering that I am a humanoid who became overly self-aware - it could happen.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting with other humans whose vibes spark with mine - hoping to do some acting for a friend who runs a comedy skit YouTube channel soon!
- 📫 You can find me on Facebook (facebook.com/chriszell.music), Instagram (@chriszell.design), and LinkedIn (linkedin.com/in/chris-zell/).
