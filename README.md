- 👋 Hi, I’m Chris! @cz-design
- 👀 I’m interested in web development, audio engineering, electrical & mechanical engineering, and more. I currently work as an industrial maintenance supervisor and proactively dedicate time to learning new things and sharpening the skills I have.
- I am also creating a rock album to use for promoting my recording skills for the studio I am building.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything interesting with other humans whose vibes spark with mine.
